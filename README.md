# Excel-Data-Projects

In these two projects I used Power Query to clean data, as well as cleaning with filters and "find and replace."
I used Power Pivot and DAX measures, as well as creating Pivot Tables and visualizations. Using a nested IF formula
I was able to better visualize age with a new column. Power Query also allowed me to do the same and create two separate conditional 
columns. There is much more that went into these projects but those are the basics. Enjoy!
